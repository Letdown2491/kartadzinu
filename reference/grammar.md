# A Grammar of Kartadzinu

*A Complete Guide to the African Romance Language*

---

## Preface

This grammar presents Kartadzinu, the language of Carthage — a Romance language representing the fictional evolution of Latin in North Africa. Unlike the Romance languages of Europe (Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian), Kartadzinu developed in isolation with significant influence from the Berber (Amazigh) languages of the region.

This book is designed for learners. Each chapter builds on the previous, with clear explanations, abundant examples, and exercises to reinforce learning. By the end, you will be able to read, write, and construct original sentences in Kartadzinu.

**How This Grammar Is Organized:**

- **Part I** covers the sounds and writing system
- **Part II** introduces nouns and how they work
- **Part III** covers pronouns and determiners
- **Part IV** addresses adjectives and adverbs
- **Part V** presents the verbal system (the heart of the language)
- **Part VI** explains how sentences are constructed
- **Part VII** covers special features unique to Kartadzinu
- **Appendices** provide reference tables and summaries

Each chapter ends with exercises. Answers appear in Appendix D.

# PART I: SOUNDS AND WRITING

---

## Chapter 1: The Sound System

Kartadzinu has a straightforward sound system inherited from Latin, with some additions from Berber contact.

**A Key Feature: No Palatalization**

Unlike most Romance languages (Italian, Spanish, French), Kartadzinu preserves Latin /k/ and /g/ before all vowels. This is a defining characteristic shared with Sardinian and attested in African Latin inscriptions. Where Italian has *cento* /tʃento/ and Spanish has *ciento* /θjento/, Kartadzinu has *kentu* /kentu/ — preserving the original Latin pronunciation.

### 1.1 Vowels

Kartadzinu has **seven vowels**, preserving a distinction lost in most other Romance languages. Like Sardinian (and probably the extinct African Romance), Kartadzinu maintains different vowels from Latin's short and long E and O.

| Letter | Sound | As in English | Latin Origin | Example |
|--------|-------|---------------|--------------|---------|
| a | /a/ | f**a**ther | Ă, Ā | *kasa* "house" |
| e | /ɛ/ | b**e**t (open) | Ĕ | *bene* "well" |
| é | /e/ | b**ay** (closed) | Ē, Ĭ | *kéna* "dinner" |
| i | /i/ | mach**i**ne | Ī | *filu* "son" |
| o | /ɔ/ | **o**ff (open) | Ŏ | *bonu* "good" |
| ó | /o/ | g**o** (closed) | Ō, Ŭ | *sólu* "alone" |
| u | /u/ | r**u**le | Ū | *luna* "moon" |

**The Sardinian Vowel System:** Unlike most Romance languages where Latin short Ĭ merged with long Ē, and short Ŭ merged with long Ō, Kartadzinu (like Sardinian) merged short Ĭ with long Ē to produce closed /e/, and short Ŭ with long Ō to produce closed /o/. The short vowels Ĕ and Ŏ remained as open /ɛ/ and /ɔ/.

| Latin | Result | Example |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Ĕ (short) | e /ɛ/ | BĔNE → *bene* "well" |
| Ē (long) | é /e/ | CĒNA → *kéna* "dinner" |
| Ĭ (short) | é /e/ | SĬCCUM → *séku* "dry" |
| Ī (long) | i /i/ | FĪLIUM → *filu* "son" |
| Ŏ (short) | o /ɔ/ | BŎNUM → *bonu* "good" |
| Ō (long) | ó /o/ | SŌLUM → *sólu* "alone" |
| Ŭ (short) | ó /o/ | GŬLAM → *góla* "throat" |
| Ū (long) | u /u/ | LŪNAM → *luna* "moon" |

**Tip for English speakers:** English "bay" and "go" end with glides (they become /eɪ/ and /oʊ/). Kartadzinu é and ó are *pure* vowels—hold the mouth position steady without moving to another sound. Think of how a French or Spanish speaker says these sounds.

### 1.2 Stress

Stress is predictable and follows Latin patterns:

- **Penultimate** (second-to-last) syllable in most words: *KA-sa*, *a-MI-ku*, *fe-MI-na*
- **Antepenultimate** (third-to-last) in certain patterns: *DÓ-mi-nu*, *KÉ-lu*

Examples:
- *KA-sa* "house"
- *FI-lu* "son"
- *fe-MI-na* "woman"
- *ki-vi-TA-te* "city"

When stress falls elsewhere, an accent mark shows this: *kivitá* (if it were stressed on the final syllable). Note that é and ó indicate vowel *quality*, not stress — a word like *kéna* has regular penultimate stress on the first syllable.

### 1.3 Syllable Structure

Kartadzinu syllables follow the pattern (C)(C)V(C)(C):

- Simple: *a*, *e*
- CV: *ka*, *lu*, *de*
- CCV: *tra*, *plu*, *kre*
- CVC: *kon*, *por*, *ter*
- CCVC: *trop*, *gran*

**Vowel clusters** usually form separate syllables:
- *a-é-re* "air" (3 syllables)
- *po-é-ta* "poet" (3 syllables)
- *kre-a-re* "to create" (3 syllables)

The combinations *kw* and *gw* count as single consonants: *kwa-tru* (2 syllables), not *ku-a-tru*.

### 1.4 Consonants

Most consonants sound like English:

| Letter | Sound | Example |
|--------|-------|---------|
| b | /b/ | *bonu* "good" |
| d | /d/ | *dia* "day" |
| f | /f/ | *fare* "to do" |
| g | /g/ always | *gatu* "cat", *gente* "people" |
| k, c | /k/ always | *kasa* "house", *kelu* "sky", *kentu* "hundred" |
| l | /l/ | *luna* "moon" |
| m | /m/ | *matri* "mother" |
| n | /n/ | *note* "night" |
| p | /p/ | *patre* "father" |
| r | /r/ (trilled) | *rosa* "rose" |
| rr | /rː/ (longer trill) | *ferru* "iron" |
| s | /s/ | *sól* "sun" |
| t | /t/ | *terra* "land" |
| v | /v/ | *vita* "life" |
| z | /z/ | *zero* "zero" |

**Important:** Unlike Italian, Spanish, or French, the letters *c/k* and *g* are **never** palatalized in Kartadzinu. They always have their "hard" sounds /k/ and /g/, even before *e* and *i*:

- *kelu* "sky" = /kelu/ (compare Italian *cielo* /tʃelo/)
- *kentu* "hundred" = /kentu/ (compare Italian *cento* /tʃento/)
- *gente* "people" = /gente/ (compare Italian *gente* /dʒente/)
- *giro* "turn" = /giro/ (compare Italian *giro* /dʒiro/)

This archaic feature connects Kartadzinu to Sardinian and reflects the Latin spoken in Roman North Africa.

**The trilled R:** Kartadzinu R is trilled (rolled), as in Spanish or Italian. The tongue tip vibrates against the ridge behind the upper teeth. Single *r* has a brief trill; double *rr* is held longer.

**Special consonant combinations:**

| Letters | Sound | Example |
|---------|-------|---------|
| ts | /ts/ (as in "ca**ts**") | *gratsia* "grace", *aktsione* "action" |
| dj | /dʒ/ (as in "**j**udge") | *djustu* "just" |
| nj | /ɲ/ (as in "ca**ny**on") | *sinjare* "to sign" |
| lj | /ʎ/ (as in "mi**lli**on") | *palju* "cloak" |
| kw, qu | /kw/ (as in "**qu**een") | *kwatru, kwandu* "four, when" |
| sh | /ʃ/ (as in "**sh**ip") | *sheol* "underworld" |

**Double consonants** are held longer:
- *terra* /ter-ra/ "land" (hold the r)
- *anno* /an-no/ "year" (hold the n)
- *bello* /bel-lo/ "beautiful" (hold the l)

### 1.5 Exercises

**A. Divide these words into syllables and mark the stressed syllable:**

1. femina
2. kivitate
3. kantare
4. profeta
5. kommunitate

**B. Pronounce these words aloud (remember: no palatalization!):**

1. kwatru (four)
2. gente (people) — /gente/, not /dʒente/
3. djustikja (justice)
4. kena (dinner)
5. kelu (sky) — /kelu/, not /tʃelu/

## Chapter 2: The Writing System

### 2.1 The Alphabet

Kartadzinu uses the Latin alphabet (A-Z) with a simplified, phonetic spelling:

**Standard letters:** a, b, d, e, f, g, h, i, k, l, m, n, o, p, r, s, t, u, v, z

**The letters C and K:**
Both represent /k/ in all positions. Modern Kartadzinu prefers *k* for clarity:
- *kasa* "house" (or *casa*)
- *kelu* "sky" (or *celu*)
- *kentu* "hundred" (or *centu*)

**The letter G:**
Always pronounced /g/ (as in "go"), never palatalized:
- *gatu* "cat"
- *gente* "people" — /gente/
- *giro* "turn" — /giro/

Unlike Italian or Spanish, there is no need for *gh* spellings — *g* is always /g/.

### 2.2 Spelling Patterns

| Sound | Spelling | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| /k/ | k, c | *kasa, kelu, kentu* |
| /g/ | g | *gatu, gente, giro* |
| /dʒ/ | dj | *djustu, djovene* |
| /ɲ/ | nj | *sinjare* |
| /kw/ | kw, qu | *kwatru, kwandu* |
| /ʃ/ | sh | *sheol* |

**Note on historical spellings:** Some texts may use *c* instead of *k*, and older religious texts may preserve Latin spellings. Both are acceptable, but *k* is preferred in modern writing for clarity.

### 2.3 Contractions

In spoken Kartadzinu, prepositions contract with following articles. These contractions are standard in everyday speech and informal writing:

**DE + article:**

| Full Form | Contraction | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| *de lu* | *du* | *la kasa du rei* "the king's house" |
| *de la* | *dela* | *lu filu dela femina* "the woman's son" |
| *de lus* | *dus* | *lus librus dus magistrus* "the teachers' books" |
| *de las* | *delas* | *la vida delas feminas* "the women's life" |

**A + article:**

| Full Form | Contraction | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| *a lu* | *al* | *Vaju al merkatu.* "I go to the market." |
| *a la* | *ala* | *Parla ala femina.* "Speak to the woman." |
| *a lus* | *als* | *Da-lu als filus.* "Give it to the children." |
| *a las* | *alas* | *Disse alas feminas.* "He said to the women." |

**EN + article:**

| Full Form | Contraction | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| *en lu* | *nu* | *Vive nu viladzju.* "He lives in the village." |
| *en la* | *nela* | *E nela kasa.* "It's in the house." |
| *en lus* | *nus* | *nus kelus* "in the heavens" |
| *en las* | *nelas* | *nelas terras* "in the lands" |

**KE + pronoun (before vowels):**

| Full Form | Contraction | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| *ke elu* | *k'elu* | *Saju k'elu vene.* "I know that he's coming." |
| *ke ela* | *k'ela* | *Kredu k'ela e iki.* "I believe she's here." |
| *ke elus* | *k'elus* | *Vide k'elus arrivaru.* "See that they arrived." |

**Notes:**
- Full forms are always correct and preferred in formal/written contexts
- Contractions are standard in speech and casual writing
- The apostrophe in *k'elu* etc. is optional: *kelu* is also acceptable

### 2.4 Punctuation and Capitalization

Kartadzinu follows standard European punctuation:
- Period (.), comma (,), question mark (?), exclamation mark (!)
- Quotation marks: « » or " "

Capitalize:
- First word of sentences
- Proper names: *Marco, Maria, Kartadze* (Carthage)
- *Deu* "God" (when referring to the deity)

### 2.4 Exercises

**A. Write these words using standard Kartadzinu spelling:**

1. /kena/ (dinner)
2. /gente/ (people)
3. /kwatro/ (four)
4. /djusto/ (just)
5. /kasa/ (house)

**B. How would you pronounce these?**

# PART II: NOUNS AND NOUN PHRASES

---

## Chapter 3: Nouns — Gender and Number

Every Kartadzinu noun has a **gender** (masculine or feminine) and a **number** (singular or plural).

### 3.1 Gender

Nouns are either masculine or feminine. There is no neuter.

**Typical patterns:**

| Ending | Gender | Examples |
|--------|--------|----------|
| -u | Masculine | *filu* "son", *libru* "book", *gatu* "cat" |
| -a | Feminine | *fila* "daughter", *terra* "land", *luna* "moon" |
| -e | Either | *patre* (m) "father", *matri* (f) "mother" |

**Natural gender** overrides endings:
- *la matri* "the mother" (feminine, despite -i ending)
- *lu patre* "the father" (masculine, despite -e ending)

**Memorize gender** for nouns ending in -e or consonants:
- *lu mare* "the sea" (masculine)
- *la note* "the night" (feminine)
- *lu sol* "the sun" (masculine)
- *la pats* "the peace" (feminine)

### 3.2 Number: Forming Plurals

The basic rule: **add -s** to the singular.

| Singular | Plural | Meaning |
|----------|--------|---------|
| *gatu* | *gatus* | cat(s) |
| *terra* | *terras* | land(s) |
| *libru* | *librus* | book(s) |
| *femina* | *feminas* | woman/women |
| *patre* | *patres* | father(s) |

**Nouns ending in -s** add *-es*:
- *mes* → *meses* "month(s)"

### 3.3 Articles

Articles agree with their noun in gender and number.

**Definite articles** ("the"):

| | Singular | Plural |
|---|----------|--------|
| Masculine | *lu* | *lus* |
| Feminine | *la* | *las* |

**Indefinite articles** ("a, an, some"):

| | Singular | Plural |
|---|----------|--------|
| Masculine | *un* | *uns* |
| Feminine | *una* | *unas* |

---

## Chapter 4: Demonstratives and Possessives

### 4.1 Demonstratives: "This" and "That"

**Proximal** ("this, these") — for things near the speaker:

| | Singular | Plural |
|---|----------|--------|
| Masculine | *istu* | *istus* |
| Feminine | *ista* | *istas* |

**Distal** ("that, those") — for things far from the speaker:

| | Singular | Plural |
|---|----------|--------|
| Masculine | *kelu* | *kelus* |
| Feminine | *kela* | *kelas* |

**Examples:**
- *istu libru* "this book"
- *ista femina* "this woman"
- *kelu omu* "that man"
- *kelas terras* "those lands"

**Abstract reference** uses the masculine singular:
- *Ke e istu?* "What is this?"
- *Kelu e veru.* "That is true."

### 4.2 Possessives: "My, Your, His..."

Possessive adjectives agree with the **thing possessed** (not the possessor):

| Person | Masc. Sg. | Fem. Sg. | Masc. Pl. | Fem. Pl. |
|--------|-----------|----------|-----------|----------|
| my | *meu* | *mea* | *meus* | *meas* |
| your (sg.) | *teu* | *tea* | *teus* | *teas* |
| his/her/its | *seu* | *sea* | *seus* | *seas* |
| our (incl.) | *nostru* | *nostra* | *nostrus* | *nostras* |
| our (excl.) | *nosin* | *nosina* | *nosins* | *nosinas* |
| your (pl.) | *vostru* | *vostra* | *vostrus* | *vostras* |
| their | *loru* | *lora* | *lorus* | *loras* |

**Examples:**
- *meu libru* "my book" (book is masculine)
- *mea kasa* "my house" (house is feminine)
- *seu patre* "his/her father"
- *nostras terras* "our lands"

**Note on "our":** Kartadzinu distinguishes:
- *nostru* — "our" including the listener
- *nosin* — "our" excluding the listener

We will cover this important distinction in Chapter 6.

### 4.3 Word Order with Possessives

Possessives normally come **before** the noun:
- *meu libru* "my book"
- *teu patre* "your father"

With the article for emphasis:
- *lu meu libru* "the book of mine" / "my book (specifically)"

### 4.4 Exercises

**A. Translate into Kartadzinu:**

1. this house
2. that man
3. these books
4. those women
5. What is that?

**B. Fill in the correct possessive:**

1. ___ matri (my mother)
2. ___ librus (your books, sg.)
3. ___ kasa (his house)
4. ___ terras (our lands, inclusive)
5. ___ filus (their sons)

# PART III: PRONOUNS

---

## Chapter 5: Personal Pronouns

### 5.1 Subject Pronouns

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | *eu* "I" | *nos* "we (incl.)" / *nosin* "we (excl.)" |
| 2nd | *tu* "you" | *vos* "you (pl.)" |
| 3rd | *elu* "he" / *ela* "she" | *elus* "they (m.)" / *elas* "they (f.)" |

Subject pronouns are often **omitted** because verb endings show the person:
- *Kantu.* "I sing." (eu understood)
- *Kantas.* "You sing." (tu understood)

Use subject pronouns for:
- **Emphasis:** *Eu kantu, tu non.* "I sing, you don't."
- **Contrast:** *Elu vide, ma ela non vide.* "He sees, but she doesn't."
- **Clarity:** *Kandu elu arrivau...* "When he arrived..."

### 5.2 Object Pronouns

Object pronouns come **before** most verb forms or **after** infinitives and imperatives.

| Person | Direct Object | Indirect Object |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| 1st sg. | *me* | *me* |
| 2nd sg. | *te* | *te* |
| 3rd sg. m. | *lu* | *li* |
| 3rd sg. f. | *la* | *li* |
| 1st pl. incl. | *nos* | *nos* |
| 1st pl. excl. | *nosin* | *nosin* |
| 2nd pl. | *vos* | *vos* |
| 3rd pl. m. | *lus* | *lis* |
| 3rd pl. f. | *las* | *lis* |

**Examples:**

- *Te amu.* "I love you."
- *Lu konestsu.* "I know him."
- *La viju.* "I see her."
- *Lis daju un libru.* "I give them a book."

**With infinitives** — attach to the end:
- *Vulu videre-te.* "I want to see you."
- *Devu dare-li lu libru.* "I must give him the book."

**With imperatives** — attach to the end:
- *Vide-me!* "See me!"
- *Da-li lu libru!* "Give him the book!"

### 5.3 Reflexive Pronouns

Used when the subject and object are the same:

| Person | Reflexive |
|--------|-----------|
| 1st sg. | *me* |
| 2nd sg. | *te* |
| 3rd sg./pl. | *se* |
| 1st pl. incl. | *nos* |
| 1st pl. excl. | *nosin* |
| 2nd pl. | *vos* |

**Examples:**
- *Me lavu.* "I wash myself."
- *Se vide en lu spekulu.* "She sees herself in the mirror."
- *Nos preparamu.* "We prepare ourselves."

### 5.4 Exercises

**A. Replace the underlined word with a pronoun:**

1. Viju **lu gatu**. →

## Chapter 6: The Inclusive/Exclusive Distinction

One of Kartadzinu's most distinctive features is its two words for "we."

### 6.1 NOS vs. NOSIN

**NOS** (inclusive) = "we" including the person you're speaking to
**NOSIN** (exclusive) = "we" not including the person you're speaking to

**Example situation:** Maria is talking to Paolo about a trip.

*Nos imu a la merkatu.* (inclusive)
→ "We're going to the market." (Maria, Paolo, and maybe others — Paolo is invited)

*Nosin imu a la merkatu.* (exclusive)
→ "We're going to the market." (Maria and others, but NOT Paolo)

### 6.2 When to Use Each

**Use NOS (inclusive) when:**
- Inviting someone to join: *Nos mandzamu?* "Shall we eat?" (together)
- Speaking of shared experiences: *Nos totus semu omus.* "We are all human."
- Religious/universal statements: *Nostru Patre...* "Our Father..." (God belongs to all)

**Use NOSIN (exclusive) when:**
- Talking about your group to an outsider: *Nosin arrivaimu averi.* "We arrived yesterday." (my group, not you)
- Distinguishing "us" from "you": *Nosin fazemu istu, vos fazets kelu.* "We do this, you do that."
- Ethnic/family identity: *Nosin traditsiones...* "Our traditions..." (our people's, not yours)

### 6.3 Possessives Follow the Same Pattern

| | Inclusive | Exclusive |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| Masc. sg. | *nostru* | *nosin* |
| Fem. sg. | *nostra* | *nosina* |
| Masc. pl. | *nostrus* | *nosins* |
| Fem. pl. | *nostras* | *nosinas* |

**Examples:**
- *nostra kasa* "our house" (yours and mine)
- *nosina kasa* "our house" (my family's, not yours)

### 6.4 Verb Agreement

Both *nos* and *nosin* use the **same verb forms** (1st person plural):
- *Nos kantamu.* "We (incl.) sing."
- *Nosin kantamu.* "We (excl.) sing."

The pronoun carries the distinction, not the verb.

### 6.5 Exercises

**A. Choose NOS or NOSIN:**

1. (To a friend) "We should eat together." → ___ devemu mandzare insimul.
2. (Telling a stranger about your family) "We came from the east." → ___ venimu de oriente.
3. (In a prayer) "Our God..." → ___ Deu...
4. (About your team to an opponent) "We will win." → ___ vinkerimu.
5. (Inviting everyone) "Let's go!" → ___ imu!

**B. Translate, using the appropriate form of "we/our":**

1. Our father gave us (his children, not you) bread.
2. Our city (everyone's) is beautiful.
3. We (you and I) are friends.
4. We (my group) don't understand.

# PART IV: ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS

---

## Chapter 7: Adjectives

### 7.1 Agreement

Adjectives agree with the noun they modify in **gender** and **number**.

**Most adjectives have four forms:**

| | Masculine | Feminine |
|---|-----------|----------|
| Singular | *-u* | *-a* |
| Plural | *-us* | *-as* |

**Example with *bonu* "good":**

| | Singular | Plural |
|---|----------|--------|
| Masculine | *bonu* | *bonus* |
| Feminine | *bona* | *bonas* |

- *un omu bonu* "a good man"
- *una femina bona* "a good woman"
- *lus omus bonus* "the good men"
- *las feminas bonas* "the good women"

**Adjectives ending in -e** have only two forms (singular/plural):
- *forte* → *fortes* "strong"
- *un omu forte* "a strong man"
- *una femina forte* "a strong woman"
- *lus omus fortes* "the strong men"

### 7.2 Position

Adjectives normally come **after** the noun:
- *un libru bonu* "a good book"
- *la femina bela* "the beautiful woman"
- *lu vinu blanku* "the white wine"

A few common adjectives can come **before** for emphasis:
- *un grandu rei* "a great king" (not just big, but great)
- *una bona ideja* "a good idea" (emphasis)

### 7.3 Comparison

**Comparative** ("more...than"):
*plu* + adjective + *ke*

- *Maria e plu alta ke Paolo.* "Maria is taller than Paolo."
- *Istu libru e plu interessante ke kelu.* "This book is more interesting than that one."

**Superlative** ("the most..."):
*lu/la plu* + adjective

- *Maria e la plu alta.* "Maria is the tallest."
- *Istu e lu libru plu interessante.* "This is the most interesting book."

**Irregular comparatives:**

| Positive | Comparative | Superlative |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| *bonu* (good) | *melju* (better) | *lu melju* / *optime* (best) |
| *malu* (bad) | *pedzu* (worse) | *lu pedzu* / *pesime* (worst) |
| *grandu* (big) | *madzu* (bigger) | *lu madzu* / *maksime* (biggest) |
| *piklu* (small) | *minu* (smaller) | *lu minu* / *minime* (smallest) |

### 7.4 Exercises

**A. Make the adjective agree:**

1. una kasa (grandu) →
2. lus omus (forte) →
3. la luna (belu) →
4. uns librus (novu) →
5. las feminas (sapiente) →

**B. Translate:**

1. A beautiful house
2. The strong men
3. Maria is taller than Paolo.
4. This is the best book.
5. A good woman

---

## Chapter 8: Adverbs

### 8.1 Formation from Adjectives

Most adverbs are formed by adding **-mente** to the feminine singular adjective:

# PART V: THE VERBAL SYSTEM

## Chapter 9: Introduction to Kartadzinu Verbs

The verbal system is the heart of Kartadzinu grammar. Understanding it requires a key insight:

**Kartadzinu prioritizes ASPECT over TENSE.**

### 9.1 What Is Aspect?

Most European languages organize verbs around **tense** — *when* something happens (past, present, future).

Kartadzinu organizes verbs around **aspect** — whether an action is **complete** or **ongoing**.

| Concept | Question It Answers |
|---------|-------------------|
| Tense | *When* did it happen? |
| Aspect | *Is it complete or ongoing?* |

### 9.2 The Two Aspects

**Imperfective** — action is ongoing, habitual, or unbounded
- *Kantu.* "I sing." / "I am singing." / "I (habitually) sing."

**Perfective** — action is complete, bounded, or viewed as a whole
- *Kantai.* "I sang." (the singing is done)

**The same event can be described either way:**

*Kandu kantava, elu entrau.*
"When I was singing (IMPF, ongoing), he entered (PFV, complete)."

### 9.3 Verb Classes

Kartadzinu verbs are grouped by their infinitive ending:

| Class | Infinitive | Example |
|-------|------------|---------|
| I | *-are* | *kantare* "to sing" |
| II | *-ere* | *vedere* "to see" |
| III | *-ire* | *dormire* "to sleep" |

**Colloquial note:** In everyday speech, Classes II and III are merging. Many speakers use Class II endings for Class III verbs:

| Formal | Colloquial | Meaning |
|--------|------------|---------|
| *dormu* | *dormu* | I sleep (same) |
| *dormes* | *dormes* | you sleep (same) |
| *dorme* | *dorme* | he/she sleeps (same) |
| *dormimu* | *dormemu* | we sleep |
| *dormits* | *dormets* | you (pl.) sleep |
| *dormen* | *dormen* | they sleep (same) |

This merger is widespread in casual speech and is not considered incorrect. Formal writing and careful speech maintain the distinction.

### 9.4 What You'll Learn

The following chapters cover:
- Chapter 10: Imperfective forms (present, habitual, ongoing)
- Chapter 11: Perfective forms (completed actions)
- Chapter 12: Subjunctive mood (wishes, doubts, hypotheticals)
- Chapter 13: Imperative mood (commands)
- Chapter 14: Compound tenses and other constructions
- Chapter 15: Aspect in depth (when to use which)

**With motion/state verbs, use *essere*:**
- *So arrivatu.* "I have arrived."

- *Avessemus partire.* "We would leave."

### 14.4 The Progressive: "Is doing"

The gerund ends in *-andu* (Class I) or *-endu/-indu* (Classes II/III):
- *kantare* → *kantandu*
- *vedere* → *vedendu*
- *dormire* → *dormindu*

**Examples:**
- *So kantandu.* "I am singing."
- *E legende un libru.* "She is reading a book."
- *Semu aspetandu.* "We are waiting."

### 14.5 Participles as Adjectives

Past participles can function as adjectives:

- *lu libru skribitu* "the written book"
- *la porta aperta* "the open door"
- *lus omus arrivatus* "the arrived men" / "the men who arrived"

Active participles (*-ante/-ente/-inte*) also work as adjectives:

## Chapter 15: Aspect in Depth

Understanding aspect is crucial for mastering Kartadzinu. This chapter explores when and why to choose each aspect.

### 15.1 The Core Distinction

**Imperfective** views action from inside — ongoing, without boundaries:
- *Kantava.* "I was singing." (inside the action)

**Perfective** views action from outside — complete, as a whole:
- *Kantai.* "I sang." (the whole event)

### 15.2 Imperfective Uses

**1. Present states and truths:**
- *So felise.* "I am happy."
- *La terra e ronda.* "The earth is round."

**2. Habitual actions:**
- *Kanto kada dia.* "I sing every day."
- *Ela sempre parla rapidamente.* "She always speaks quickly."

**3. Ongoing background:**
- *Lu sol brillava.* "The sun was shining." (background)
- *Dormiva kandu...* "I was sleeping when..."

**4. Descriptions:**
- *La kasa era granda e bela.* "The house was big and beautiful."
- *Elu aviva lus kapilus njirus.* "He had black hair."

### 15.3 Perfective Uses

**1. Completed events:**
- *Kantai la kantsone.* "I sang the song." (done)
- *Ela arrivau.* "She arrived."

**2. Sequences of events:**
- *Arrivai, mandzai, dormiai.* "I arrived, ate, slept."

**3. Bounded durations:**
- *Vivai ili por du annus.* "I lived there for two years." (bounded)

**4. Foreground events in narrative:**
- *Lu rei entrau. Vidau la reina. Parlau.*
  "The king entered. He saw the queen. He spoke."

### 15.4 Contrast in Context

*Kandu kantava, elu entrau.*
"When I was singing (IMPF, background), he entered (PFV, event)."

*Kantava en la ekklesja kada duminika.*
"I used to sing in church every Sunday." (habitual, IMPF)

*Kantai en la ekklesja duminika passata.*
"I sang in church last Sunday." (single event, PFV)

### 15.5 Telicity Markers

Kartadzinu has particles that further specify completion status:

**JA** "already" — marks achieved completion:
- *Ja kantai.* "I have already sung."
- *Ja so velju.* "I am already old." (achieved state)

**ASET** "still" — marks ongoing without completion:
- *Aset kanto.* "I still sing." / "I'm still singing."
- *Aset kerkamu.* "We're still seeking."

**-MENT** (suffix) — marks action through to its endpoint:
- *kantare-ment* "to sing through to the end"
- *Devu legere-ment lu libru.* "I must read the book through."

### 15.6 Cultural Note

The aspect system reflects Kartadzinu worldview:
- **Process over outcome** — becoming matters more than being
- **Spiritual journeys** use imperfective: *Aset devenimu sapientis.* "We're still becoming wise."
- **Divine action** is often imperfective: *Deu kreante* "God creating" (ongoing)

### 15.7 Exercises

**A. Choose the appropriate aspect:**

1. Yesterday, Maria (kantava / kantai) a beautiful song.
2. When I was young, I (viveva / vivai) in Carthage.
3. The sun (brillava / brillau) when we (arrivava / arrivaimu).
4. She always (parla / parlau) quickly.
5. He (legeva / legau) the book in one day.

**B. Add the appropriate telicity marker (ja, aset, or -ment):**

1. ___ arrivau. (He has already arrived.)
2. ___ kerkamu la veritate. (We're still seeking the truth.)
3. Devu pratikare___ girare. (I must practice girare thoroughly.)
4. ___ so velju. (I'm already old.)
5. Ela ___ vive iki. (She still lives here.)

# PART VI: SENTENCE STRUCTURE

---

## Chapter 16: Basic Word Order

### 16.1 The Standard Pattern: SVO

Kartadzinu's basic word order is **Subject-Verb-Object**:

- *Maria vide lu gatu.* "Maria sees the cat."
  - Subject: *Maria*
  - Verb: *vide*
  - Object: *lu gatu*

- *Eu amu tea matri.* "I love your mother."
- *Lus filus mandzaru lu pane.* "The children ate the bread."

### 16.2 Questions

**Yes/No questions** can be formed in two ways:

**1. Rising intonation** (most common):
- *Tu vides lu gatu?* "Do you see the cat?"
- *Maria arrivau?* "Did Maria arrive?"

**2. Question particle *wa*** (optional, adds emphasis or formality):
- *Wa tu vides lu gatu?* "Do you see the cat?"
- *Wa Maria arrivau?* "Did Maria arrive?"
- *Wa venes kon nos?* "Will you come with us?"

The particle *wa* (from Arabic influence) appears at the beginning of yes/no questions. It's optional but common in:
- Formal speech
- When genuinely uncertain of the answer
- Polite requests: *Wa podes ajudare me?* "Could you help me?"

**Question words** come at the beginning:

| Word | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| *ke* | what | *Ke vides?* "What do you see?" |
| *ki* | who | *Ki arrivau?* "Who arrived?" |
| *kandu* | when | *Kandu partis?* "When are you leaving?" |
| *onde* | where | *Onde vives?* "Where do you live?" |
| *porke* | why | *Porke kantas?* "Why do you sing?" |
| *kom* | how | *Kom stas?* "How are you?" |
| *kwale* | which | *Kwale libru vules?* "Which book do you want?" |
| *kwantu* | how much/many | *Kwantu kosta?* "How much does it cost?" |

**Note:** *Wa* is not used with question words — the question word itself signals a question.

### 16.3 Negation

Place *non* before the verb:

- *Non viju.* "I don't see."
- *Ela non parla Kartadzinu.* "She doesn't speak Kartadzinu."
- *Non ai tempu.* "I don't have time."

**Double negation** is standard:
- *Non viju nula.* "I don't see anything." (lit. "not see nothing")
- *Non konestsu nulu.* "I don't know anyone."
- *Non iau numka.* "I never went."

## Chapter 17: VSO Word Order

While SVO is standard, Kartadzinu uses **Verb-Subject-Object** order in specific contexts.

### 17.1 After Certain Adverbs

After *alora* "then", *kandu* "when", *onde* "where", *iki* "here", *ili* "there":

**SVO (neutral):**
*Lu rei arrivau.* "The king arrived."

**VSO (after adverb):**
*Alora arrivau lu rei.* "Then arrived the king."

More examples:
- *Kandu entrau Maria, eu dormiva.* "When Maria entered, I was sleeping."
- *Iki repoza lu santu.* "Here rests the saint."
- *Ili vive meu fratru.* "There lives my brother."

### 17.2 In Narrative Style

VSO adds dramatic effect in storytelling:

*Vinit lu rei. Vidau la reina. Parlau: "Salve!"*
"Came the king. He saw the queen. He spoke: 'Greetings!'"

Compare neutral:
*Lu rei vinit. Elu vidau la reina. Elu parlau: "Salve!"*

### 17.3 In Formal Questions

Formal or literary style inverts subject and verb:

**Casual:** *Tu vas onde?* "Where are you going?"
**Formal:** *Onde vas tu?* "Where goest thou?"

**Casual:** *Tu vides ke?* "What do you see?"
**Formal:** *Ke vides tu?* "What seest thou?"

### 17.4 In Elevated/Religious Register

Religious and philosophical texts prefer VSO:

- *Disse lu Dominu: "So eu."* "Said the Lord: 'I am.'"
- *Vinit la salvatsione.* "Came salvation."
- *Alora parlaru lus profetas.* "Then spoke the prophets."

### 17.5 Summary

| Context | Word Order | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Normal statement | SVO | *Maria vide lu gatu.* |
| After adverbs | VSO | *Alora vidau Maria lu gatu.* |
| Narrative/dramatic | VSO | *Vinit lu rei.* |
| Formal questions | VSO | *Onde vas tu?* |
| Religious register | VSO | *Disse lu Dominu.* |

## Chapter 18: Complex Sentences

### 18.1 Coordination: Joining Equal Clauses

**E** "and":
- *Maria kanta e Paolo dansa.* "Maria sings and Paolo dances."
- *Ai un libru e una pena.* "I have a book and a pen."

**MA** "but":
- *E piklu ma forte.* "He is small but strong."
- *Vulu ire ma non ai tempu.* "I want to go but I don't have time."

**O** "or":
- *Venes oi o kras?* "Are you coming today or tomorrow?"
- *Kafe o te?* "Coffee or tea?"

**Correlatives:**
- *e...e* "both...and": *E Maria e Paolo kantan.* "Both Maria and Paolo sing."
- *o...o* "either...or": *O venes o restas.* "Either you come or you stay."
- *ni...ni* "neither...nor": *Ni viju ni odiu.* "I neither see nor hear."

### 18.2 Subordination: Dependent Clauses

**KE** introduces most subordinate clauses:

*Saju ke elu vive iki.* "I know that he lives here."
*Kredu ke e veru.* "I believe that it's true."
*Disse ke iau venire.* "He said that he would come."

**SE** introduces conditions:

*Se pluve, non vaju.* "If it rains, I won't go."
*Se avesse tempu, videssu te.* "If I had time, I would see you."

**PORKE** introduces reasons:

*Non iau porke era malatu.* "I didn't go because I was sick."
*Kanto porke so felise.* "I sing because I'm happy."

**KANDU** introduces time:

*Kandu arrivau, dormiva.* "When he arrived, I was sleeping."
*Kanteru kandu venets.* "I'll sing when you come."

### 18.3 Relative Clauses

**KE** (invariable) introduces relative clauses:

*Lu omu ke viju e meu patre.* "The man that I see is my father."
*La femina ke parla e mea matri.* "The woman who speaks is my mother."
*Lu libru ke legai era bonu.* "The book that I read was good."

For locations, use **ONDE**:
*La kasa onde vive e granda.* "The house where he lives is big."

For possession, use **DE KI** or restructure:
*Lu omu de ki lu filu e malatu...* "The man whose son is sick..."
*Lu omu kon lu filu malatu...* "The man with the sick son..."

**Colloquial note:** When *ke* introduces a clause where it's the **direct object**, it can be dropped in casual speech:

| Formal | Colloquial | Meaning |
|--------|------------|---------|
| *Lu libru ke legai* | *Lu libru legai* | "The book (that) I read" |
| *La femina ke vidai* | *La femina vidai* | "The woman (that) I saw" |
| *Lu filmu ke volemu videre* | *Lu filmu volemu videre* | "The movie (that) we want to see" |

This dropping is **not possible** when *ke* is the subject:
- *Lu omu ke parla...* (correct) — NOT *~~Lu omu parla...~~*

### 18.4 Participle Clauses (Alternative to KE)

In formal style, participles can replace relative clauses:

**With KE:** *Lu omu ke kanta e meu amiku.*
**With participle:** *Lu omu kantante e meu amiku.*
"The man singing is my friend."

**With KE:** *Lu libru ke fue skritu por Maria...*
**With participle:** *Lu libru skritu por Maria...*
"The book written by Maria..."

This is especially common in literary and religious texts.

# PART VII: SPECIAL FEATURES

---

## Chapter 19: The Construct State

One of Kartadzinu's most distinctive features is the **construct state** — a special noun form used for close relationships.

### 19.1 What Is the Construct State?

In most Romance languages, possession uses "of":
- Spanish: *el hijo del rey* "the son of the king"
- French: *le fils du roi* "the son of the king"

Kartadzinu has an **alternative** for intimate or permanent connections: the **construct state**, where two nouns combine directly:

*lu fil-rei* "the prince" (lit. "the son-king")

The first noun drops its final vowel and connects directly to the second.

### 19.2 Formation

| Original Ending | Construct Form | Example |
|-----------------|----------------|---------|
| -u (m.) | drop -u | *filu* → *fil-* |
| -a (f.) | drop -a | *terra* → *terr-* |
| -e | drop -e | *patre* → *patr-* |

**Pattern:** CONSTRUCT + POSSESSOR

*fil-rei* = son + king = "king's son" / "prince"
*terr-patria* = land + fatherland = "homeland"
*kor-omu* = heart + man = "man's heart"

### 19.3 When to Use Construct State

**USE CONSTRUCT for:**

**1. Inalienable possession** (body parts, family):
- *kor-meu* "my heart"
- *patr-meu* "my father"
- *matri-Maria* "Maria's mother"
- *okulus-ela* "her eyes"

**2. Fixed compounds**:
- *fil-rei* "prince" (son-of-king)
- *dem-prets* "temple" (house-of-prayer)
- *via-sapiensa* "spiritual path" (way-of-wisdom)

**3. Titles and divine names**:
- *Fil-Deu* "Son of God"
- *Matri-Ekklesja* "Mother Church"
- *Spiritu-Veritate* "Spirit of Truth"

**USE FREE STATE + DE for:**

**1. Alienable possession** (things that can be sold/lost):
- *lu libru de lu magistru* "the teacher's book"
- *la kasa de meu patre* "my father's house"

**2. Temporary relationships**:
- *la amiga de Maria* "Maria's friend"

**3. Emphasis or clarification**:
- *lu filu de lu rei* "the son OF THE KING" (emphasizing which king)

### 19.4 Articles with Construct State

The article goes on the **first** noun:
- *lu fil-rei* "the king's son"
- *la matri-Maria* "Mary's mother"

Adjectives follow the **entire** construction:
- *lu fil-rei novu* "the new prince"
- *la terr-patria sankta* "the holy homeland"

### 19.5 Construct Chains

Multiple constructs can chain together:
- *fil-matri-rei* "son of the king's mother" = "the king's maternal grandson"
- *kor-fil-rei* "the prince's heart"

### 19.6 Exercises

**A. Form construct state compounds:**

1. filu + rei (prince) →
2. koru + omu (man's heart) →
3. terra + patria (homeland) →
4. matri + Deu (Mother of God) →
5. domo + prets (temple) →

**B. Choose construct or DE:**

1. My heart (inalienable) → ___
2. The teacher's book (alienable) → ___
3. Son of God (title) → ___
4. My father's car (possession) → ___
5. Maria's mother (family) → ___

**C. Translate:**

1. The prince arrived.
2. My father's house is big.
3. The man's heart is pure.
4. The Son of God spoke.
5. Our homeland is beautiful.

## Chapter 20: Focus and Emphasis

Kartadzinu uses several strategies to highlight important information in a sentence.

### 20.1 Cleft Constructions

The most common way to emphasize a noun phrase is the **cleft construction**: *E... ke* "It is... that/who"

**Neutral:**
*Lu omu vidau la femina.* "The man saw the woman."

**Emphasizing the subject (who did it):**
*E lu omu ke vidau la femina.* "It's THE MAN who saw the woman."

**Emphasizing the object (what was affected):**
*E la femina ke lu omu vidau.* "It's THE WOMAN that the man saw."

### 20.2 Question-Answer Pairs

Cleft constructions naturally answer *ki* "who" and *ke* "what" questions:

**Agent question:**
Q: *Ki vidau la femina?* "Who saw the woman?"
A: *E lu omu ke vidau-la.* "It's the man who saw her."

**Patient question:**
Q: *Ke mandzau teu fratru?* "What did your brother eat?"
A: *E pane ke elu mandzau.* "It's bread that he ate."

### 20.3 Fronting for Emphasis

Another strategy is moving the emphasized element to the front of the sentence:

**Neutral:** *Vidai Maria averi.* "I saw Maria yesterday."
**Object fronted:** *Maria vidai averi.* "MARIA I saw yesterday."

**Neutral:** *Elu dau lu libru a me.* "He gave the book to me."
**Indirect object fronted:** *A me elu dau lu libru.* "To ME he gave the book."

### 20.4 Emphatic Pronouns

For pronominal emphasis, use the stressed pronoun forms with *mesu* "self":

- *Eu mesu fazai istu.* "I MYSELF did this."
- *Ela mesa vidau-lu.* "SHE HERSELF saw him."
- *Elus mesus disseru istu.* "THEY THEMSELVES said this."

### 20.5 Focus in Narrative

In elevated narrative style, VSO word order combined with clefts creates emphasis:

*Alora e lu profeta ke disse: "Kerkate la via!"*
"Then it was THE PROPHET who said: 'Seek the path!'"

*E Deu ke kreau lu mundu.*
"It is GOD who created the world."

*E lu mundu ke Deu kreau.*
"It is THE WORLD that God created."

### 20.6 Exercises

**A. Rewrite with a cleft construction to emphasize the underlined word:**

1. **Maria** vidau lu gatu. →
2. Lu rei mandzau **lu pane**. →
3. **Meu fratru** skribau la lettera. →
4. Ela dau lu libru **a me**. →
5. **Deu** ama nos. →

**B. Translate using cleft constructions:**

1. It's the king who spoke.
2. It's bread that we ate.
3. Who built the house? — It's my father who built it.
4. What did she see? — It's the moon that she saw.
5. I myself wrote this book.

## Chapter 21: Telicity and Completion

Beyond basic aspect, Kartadzinu uses **particles and preverbs** to mark completion status precisely.

### 21.1 The Telicity System

| Marker | Type | Meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| *ja* | preverbal particle | already, achieved |
| *aset* | preverbal particle | still, ongoing |
| *tra-* | preverb (prefix) | through to completion |

### 21.2 JA — "Already"

Marks that an action or state has been **achieved**:

**With perfective (past completion):**
- *Ja kantai.* "I have already sung."
- *Ja arrivau.* "He has already arrived."

**With imperfective (achieved state):**
- *Ja so velju.* "I'm already old."
- *Ja konesits la veritate.* "You already know the truth."

### 21.3 ASET — "Still"

Marks that an action or state **continues without endpoint**:

**Ongoing action:**
- *Aset kanto.* "I still sing." / "I'm still singing."
- *Aset kerkamu.* "We're still seeking."

**Continuing state:**
- *Aset so djovene.* "I'm still young."
- *Aset vive iki.* "She still lives here."

### 21.4 TRA- — "Through to Completion"

The preverb *tra-* (from Latin TRANS "through") attaches to verbs to indicate carrying an action **through to its natural end**:

| Base Verb | With tra- | Meaning |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| *legere* "to read" | *tra-legere* | "to read through (completely)" |
| *kantare* "to sing" | *tra-kantare* | "to sing through (the whole song)" |
| *kerkare* "to seek" | *tra-kerkare* | "to search thoroughly" |
| *videre* "to see" | *tra-videre* | "to see through, examine" |
| *passare* "to pass" | *tra-passare* | "to pass through, traverse" |

**Conjugation:** *tra-* verbs conjugate like their base verb:

- *Tra-legai lu libru.* "I read through the book."
- *Tra-kantamu la kantsone.* "We sang the whole song."
- *Tra-kerkate ben!* "Search thoroughly!"

**Note:** In casual speech, *tra* can appear as a separate particle:
- *Ledzai tra lu libru.* = *Tra-legai lu libru.* "I read through the book."

### 21.5 Combinations

Markers can combine for nuanced meanings:

*Ja aset devenimu sapientis.*
"We have already-but-still become wise." (reached wisdom but keep growing)

*Aset non ja arrivau.*
"He still hasn't arrived yet."

*Ja tra-legai lu libru.*
"I have already read through the book."

### 21.6 Cultural Significance

These markers reflect Kartadzinu philosophy:

- Spiritual growth uses *aset*: *Aset devenimu.* "We're still becoming."
- Achievement uses *ja*: *Ja trovaimu la via.* "We have found the path."
- Thoroughness uses *tra-*: *tra-girare* "to whirl through the complete practice"

### 21.7 Exercises

**A. Add the appropriate telicity marker:**

1. I have already eaten. → ___ mandzai.
2. She still lives here. → ___ vive iki.
3. Read the book through. → ___-lege lu libru.
4. We're still seeking. → ___ kerkamu.
5. He has already arrived. → ___ arrivau.

**B. Translate:**

1. I'm still young.
2. We have already become wise.
3. Search thoroughly!
4. She still doesn't know.
5. I read through the whole book yesterday.
