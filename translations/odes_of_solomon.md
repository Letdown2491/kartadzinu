# ODES OF SOLOMON / ODAS DE SALOMONE
## Bilingual Edition: English - Kartadzinu

*Early Christian mystical hymns (c. 80-125 CE)*

---

## Introduction

**The Odes of Solomon** are a collection of 42 ancient hymns, likely composed in Syriac in the late first or early second century CE. They represent some of the earliest Christian devotional poetry, rich with mystical imagery of light, water, and divine love. Though attributed pseudonymously to King Solomon, they reflect early Jewish-Christian spirituality.

These Odes are ideally suited to showcase Kartadzinu's distinctive features:

- **Mystical vocabulary**: The semantic shift where *sapere* means direct/experiential knowing
- **Water imagery**: Using *aman* (sacred water) and *akwa/agu* (ordinary water)
- **Construct state**: For divine relationships and spiritual concepts
- **Participles as predicates**: Describing divine attributes and ongoing spiritual states
- **Imperative/hortatory forms**: The invitational tone of devotional poetry
- **Telicity markers**: *ja* for achieved spiritual states

The English text follows James Charlesworth's scholarly translation.

## ODE 11 / ODA XI
### The Living Water / La Akwa Vivente

**English:**
My heart was cloven and its flower appeared,
And grace sprang up in it,
And it brought forth fruit to the Lord.

For the Most High clove my heart by his Holy Spirit,
And searched my affections toward him,
And filled me with his love.

And his opening of me became my salvation,
And I ran in his way in his peace,
In the way of truth from the beginning to the end.

I received his knowledge,
And was established upon the rock of truth,
Where he set me.

And speaking waters drew near my lips
From the fountain of the Lord generously.
And I drank and was intoxicated
With the living water that does not die.

And my intoxication was not one without knowledge,
But I forsook vanity,
And turned to the Most High, my God,
And was enriched by his gift.

**Kartadzinu:**
Kor-meu fue fenditu e flora-ela aparau,
E gratsia surgvit en-elu,
E portau fruktu a lu Dóminu.

Porke lu Altisimu fendau kor-meu per Spiritu Santu-ela,
E kerkau afeksiones-meas vers elu,
E plenau me kon amor-ela.

E apertura-ela de me devinistu salvatsione-mea,
E kursai en via-ela en pats-ela,
En la via de veritate de lu initsju a la fine.

Retsebai konjitsione-ela,
E fue establitu su la petra de veritate,
Onde elu situau me.

E akwas parlantes apropinkwaru labias-meas
De la fónte de lu Dóminu generosamente.
E bevai e fue inebriatu
Kon la akwa vivente ke non more.

E inebriatsione-mea non fue una sen konjitsione,
Ma abandonai vanitate,
E turnai a lu Altisimu, Déu-meu,
E fue enrikitu per dónu-ela.

## ODE 19 / ODA XIX
### The Milk of the Father / Lu Lakta de lu Patre

**English:**
A cup of milk was offered to me,
And I drank it in the sweetness of the Lord's kindness.

The Son is the cup,
And the Father is he who was milked;
And the Holy Spirit is she who milked him;
Because his breasts were full,
And it was undesirable that his milk should be released ineffectually.

The Holy Spirit opened her bosom,
And mixed the milk of the two breasts of the Father.
And she gave the mixture to the world without their knowing,
And those who receive it are in the fullness of the right hand.

The womb of the Virgin took it,
And she received conception and gave birth.
And the Virgin became a mother with great mercies;
And she labored and bore a Son, without incurring pain;
Because it did not happen without purpose.

And she did not require a midwife,
Because he caused her to give life.
She brought forth, as a strong man, by will,
And bore according to the manifestation,
And acquired according to the great power.

**Kartadzinu:**
Una kuppa de lakta fue oferta a me,
E bevai-la en la dultsitate de benignitate de lu Dóminu.

Lu Filu e la kuppa,
E lu Patre e elu ke fue mulgitu;
E lu Spiritu Santu e ela ke mulgau-lu;
Porke mamelas-ela furu plenas,
E fue indesirable ke lakta-ela fuvesse liberatu sen efetu.

Lu Spiritu Santu aperau sinu-ela,
E meskau lu lakta de lus dua mamelas de lu Patre.
E ela dau la mestura a lu mundu sen konjitsione-sus,
E kelus ke retseban ela son en la plenitudine de la manu destra.

Lu uteru de la Virgine prenau-la,
E ela retsebau kontseptsione e parau.
E la Virgine devinistu matri kon grandis miserikordjus;
E ela laborau e parau un Filu, sen inkurere dolóru;
Porke non akontekaivit sen propositu.

E ela non rekwesivit obstetritsa,
Porke elu kazau ela a dare vita.
Ela portau, kom un omu forte, per volontate,
E parau sekundu la manifestatsione,
E akwirivit sekundu la potensa granda.

## ODE 30 / ODA XXX
### The Living Fountain / La Fonte Vivente

**English:**
Fill yourselves with water from the living fountain of the Lord,
For it has been opened to you.

Come, all you who are thirsty, and take a drink,
And rest beside the fountain of the Lord.
For beautiful it is and pure,
And it gives rest to the soul.

Much more pleasant are its waters than honey,
And the honeycomb of bees is not to be compared with it.
For it flows from the lips of the Lord,
And from the heart of the Lord is its name.

And it came infinite and invisible,
And until it was set in the midst, they did not know it.

Blessed are those who have drunk from it,
And have found rest by it.

**Kartadzinu:**
Plenate vós-mésus kon akwa de la fónte vivente de lu Dóminu,
Porke ela ja fue aperta a vos.

Venite, totus vos ke sets sitjentus, e prendite un potatsione,
E repozate adlatu la fónte de lu Dóminu.
Porke bela e ela e pura,
E ela da reposu a la anima.

Lon plu plasentes son akwas-ela ke mele,
E lu favu de apas non e por essere komparatu kon ela.
Porke ela flue de labias de lu Dóminu,
E de lu koru de lu Dóminu e nóme-ela.

E vinistu infinita e invisibile,
E fina ke fue situata en lu mesu, elus non sapiveru ela.

Beatae son kelus ke ja beviveru de ela,
E ja trovaveru reposu per ela.

## ODE 6 / ODA VI
### The Spirit and the Harp / Lu Spiritu e la Harpa

**English:**
As the hand moves over the harp,
And the strings speak,
So speaks in my members the Spirit of the Lord,
And I speak by his love.

For he destroys what is foreign,
And everything is of the Lord.

For so it was from the beginning
And will be until the end.
That nothing should be his adversary,
And nothing should rise up against him.

The Lord has multiplied his knowledge
And was zealous that those things should be known
Which by his grace have been given to us.

And his praise he gave us on account of his name;
Our spirits praise his Holy Spirit.

**Kartadzinu:**
Kom la manu move su la harpa,
E lus kordas parlan,
Alsi parla en membrus-meus lu Spiritu de lu Dóminu,
E eu parlu per amor-ela.

Porke elu destrue ke e ekstraneru,
E totalmente e de lu Dóminu.

Porke alsi fut de lu initsju
E serat fina la fine.
Ke nula devesse essere adversarju-ela,
E nula devesse surgere kontra elu.

Lu Dóminu multiplikau konjitsione-ela
E fue zelu ke kelas kozas devessen essere konesutae
Ke per gratsia-ela ja furu datae a nos.

E laude-ela dau a nos propter nóme-ela;
Spiritus-nostrus laudan Spiritu Santu-ela.

## ODE 8 / ODA VIII
### Open Your Hearts / Aperite Kordjus-Vostrus

**English:**
Open, open your hearts to the exultation of the Lord,
And let your love abound from the heart to the lips.

To bring forth fruit to the Lord, a holy life,
And to speak with watchfulness in his light.

Rise up and stand erect,
You who sometimes were brought low.
You who were in silence, speak,
For your mouth has been opened.

You who were despised, from henceforth be lifted up,
For your righteousness has been lifted up.
For the right hand of the Lord is with you,
And he will be your helper.

And peace was prepared for you
Before your war took place.
Hear the word of truth
And receive the knowledge of the Most High.

**Kartadzinu:**
Aperite, aperite kordjus-vostrus a la eksultatsione de lu Dóminu,
E ke amor-vostru abunde de lu kordju a lus labias.

Por portare fruktu a lu Dóminu, una vita sankta,
E por parlare kon viljansa en luts-ela.

Alzate-vos e state erektu,
Vos ke alkandu fuvistis abassatus.
Vos ke fuvistis en silentsju, parlate,
Porke bukka-vostra ja fue aperta.

Vos ke fuvistis despresatus, de ora avante siets alzatus,
Porke gustitsja-vostra ja fue alzata.
Porke la manu destra de lu Dóminu e kon vos,
E elu serat ajudatore-vostru.

E pats fue preparata por vos
Ante ke guerra-vostra akontekaivesse.
Odite la parabula de veritate
E retsebite la konjitsione de lu Altisimu.

## ODE 42 / ODA XLII
### The Descent to Sheol / La Deshensione a Sheol

**English:**
I extended my hands and approached my Lord,
For the stretching out of my hands is his sign.

My extension is the common cross
That was lifted up on the way of the Righteous One.

I became useless to those who did not take hold of me,
And I shall be with those who love me.

All those who persecuted me have died,
And those who trusted in me sought me, because I am living.

And I arose and am with them,
And I will speak through their mouths.

For they have despised those who persecuted them,
And I lifted over them the yoke of my love.

Like the arm of the bridegroom over the bride,
So is my yoke over those who know me.

And as the bridal chamber is spread out in the house of the bridal pair,
So is my love over those who believe in me.

I was not rejected, though I was considered to be so,
I did not perish, though they thought it of me.

Sheol saw me and was shattered,
And death ejected me and many with me.

I have been vinegar and bitterness to it,
And I went down with it as far as its depth.

And the feet and the head it released,
For it could not endure my face.

And I made a congregation of living ones among the dead,
And I spoke with them with living lips,
So that my word might not be void.

And those who had died ran toward me,
And they cried out and said, "Son of God, have pity on us!"

**Kartadzinu:**
Ekstendai manus-meas e apropinkwai Dóminu-meu,
Porke la ekstensione de manus-meas e sinjalu-ela.

Ekstensione-mea e la krutse komuna
Ke fue alzata su la via de lu Djustu.

Devinistu inutile a kelus ke non arpiveru me,
E seru kon kelus ke aman me.

Totus kelus ke persekutiverume ja moriveru,
E kelus ke kofidaveru en me kerkaveru me, porke so vivente.

E surgai e so kon-elus,
E parleru tra bukkae-sus.

Porke elus ja despresaveru kelus ke persekutiveru-lus,
E alzai super-elus lu gugu de amor-meu.

Kom lu bratsu de lu sposu super la sposa,
Alsi e gugu-meu super kelus ke konesan me.

E kom la kamera nuptsjala e ekstensa en la domo de lu paru nuptsjale,
Alsi e amor-meu super kelus ke kredan en me.

Non fui refjutatu, ankam fui konsideratu alsi,
Non perii, ankam elus pensaveru istu de me.

Sheol vidau me e fue frakasata,
E morte egektau me e multus kon me.

Fui atseitu e amarititu a ela,
E deshendai kon ela tan lon kom profunditate-ela.

E lus pes e lu kapu ela liberau,
Porke ela non podivit endurare fatsa-mea.

E fazai una kongregatsione de viventes inter lus mortus,
E parlai kon-elus kon labias viventes,
Median parabula-mea non fuvesse vakwa.

E kelus ke ja moriveru kursaru vers me,
E klamaru e disseru, "Filu de Deu, aite pietate de nos!"
