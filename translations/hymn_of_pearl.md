# THE HYMN OF THE PEARL / IMNU DE LA PERLA
## Bilingual Edition: English - Kartadzinu

*A Gnostic text from the Acts of Thomas*

---

## Introduction

**The Hymn of the Pearl** (also known as the Hymn of the Soul) is a Gnostic poem preserved within the apocryphal Acts of Thomas, likely composed in Syriac in the 2nd-3rd century CE. It tells an allegorical story of a prince sent from the East to Egypt to retrieve a pearl guarded by a serpent—widely interpreted as the soul's descent into the material world and its awakening to its divine origin.

This text showcases several distinctive Kartadzinu features:

- **Construct state**: For inalienable possession and titles (*rejn-patr-meu* "my father's kingdom", *patr-matri* "father-mother")
- **VSO word order**: In narrative passages for dramatic effect (*Alora partiai de Oriente*)
- **Telicity markers**: *ja* marking completed states and achievements
- **Cleft constructions**: For emphasis (*E ela ke...* "It is she who...")
- **Participles as predicates**: Describing ongoing states (*nutriente*, *kondukentes*)
- **Semantic shifts**: *via* as spiritual path, *sapere* for direct knowing

The English text is adapted from scholarly translations of the Syriac original.

## I. THE DEPARTURE / LU PARTIMENTU

**English:**
When I was still a child,  
dwelling in my father's kingdom,  
resting in the riches and luxury  
of my father's mother who nurtured me,  

they prepared provisions for my journey —  
a great bundle but light,  
that I could carry alone.  

They sent gold from Bet-Ellaye, our highland,  
and silver from the treasurers of Gazak,  
place of great riches.  

They armed me with adamant  
that can break iron.  

They pulled off from me my glory-robe,  
and my purple cloak,  
sewn according to my greatness.  

**Kartadzinu:**
Kandu fui eu ankora infantu,  
abitandu en rejn-patr-meu,  
repozandu en rikisi e luxsu  
de matri-patr-meu nutriente,  

prepararu-me provizjoni por lu viaggu —  
paketu grandu ma levere,  
ke podesse portare eu solu.  

Oru mandaru de Bet-Ellaje, terr-altur-nostru,  
e argentu de lu trezoreri-Gazzak,  
loku de rikisi magnae.  

Armaru-me kon adamantu  
ke pode romppere ferru.  

Tiraveru de me mea tóga-glória,  
e meu paliu purpureu,  
kesitus sekundu mea grandesa.  

---

## II. THE PACT / LU PAKTU

**English:**
They made a pact with me  
and wrote it in my heart, that I might not forget:  

"If you descend to Egypt  
and bring back the One Pearl,  
that which rests in the midst of the Roaring Sea,  
surrounded by the winging Serpent,  

then you shall put on again your glory-robe  
and your purple cloak over it,  
and you shall become a hero with your second brother,  
and you shall be a deputy in our Father's kingdom."  

**Kartadzinu:**
Fazaru paktu kon me  
e skribiveru-lu en kor-meu, median non obliviesse:  

"Se tu deshendes a Egitu  
e portas la Perla Unu,  
kela ke repoza en mesu de Mar-Raukantu,  
tsirkum de Serpente ruflante,  

alora vestira-te ja tu tóga-glória  
e teu paliu purpureu supra-ela,  
e devenirats herovu kon fratru-te sekundu,  
e seirats deputatu en rejn-Patr-nostru."

## III. THE JOURNEY / LU VIAGGU

**English:**
Then I departed from the East,  
descending a difficult and dangerous journey,  
with two guides leading.  

I did not know the way,  
for I was still young to travel.  

When we crossed the borders of Maishan,  
meeting place of merchants of the East,  
and we arrived in the lands of Babylon —  

we entered Sarbug, city of Bet-Ellaye.  

**Kartadzinu:**
Alora partiai de Oriente,  
deshendendu viaggu difitsilu e perikulozu,  
kon doi guidas kondukentes.  

Non koneseva eu la via,  
porke fui ankora djovene por viagare.  

Kandu traversaimu frontjeri de Majshan,  
loku de rendevu de merkatoris de Oriente,  
e arrivaimu a terras de Babilonia —  

entraimus en Sarbug, kivitate de Bet-Ellaje.

## IV. AMONG THE EGYPTIANS / ENTRE LUS EGITUS

**English:**
Then we descended to Egypt.  
My companions separated from me.  

I went directly toward the Serpent,  
dwelling near his habitation,  
waiting while he slept and rested,  
so that I could take the Pearl from him.  

But because I was alone,  
a stranger to my companions of habitation,  
they saw me, a man of my race,  
young and beautiful, son of kings,  
one of our anointed.  

We became intimate and companions,  
that we might warn one another against the Egyptians  
and against commerce with the impure.  

But I dressed in their garments,  
lest they suspect I was a stranger,  
come from outside to take the Pearl,  
and arouse the Serpent against me.  

**Kartadzinu:**
Alora deshendimu a Egitu.  
Separaveru-se de me meus kompanjunes.  

Iaimu direktamente vers Serpente,  
abitandu pres habitatsione-ela,  
aspetandu medan kelu dormiesse e repozesse,  
por ke podesse prendere la Perla de-elu.  

Ma porke fui eu solu,  
ekstraneru a meus kompanjunus de abitatsione,  
videveru-me unu omu de rasa-mea,  
djovene e belu, filu de reges,  
unu de untsutu-nostru.  

Devinimu intimi e kompanjunus,  
ke avertisse lu unu lu altru kontra lus Egitus  
e kontra lu kommerse kon lus impurus.  

Ma vestiaime kon vestitus-sus,  
medan non suspetessen ke fui ekstraneru,  
venentu de fora por portare la Perla,  
e ekstsissen Serpente kontra me.

## V. THE FORGETTING / LU OBLIVIDU

**English:**
But somehow — I know not how —  
they learned that I was not their kinsman.  

I dealt with them  
and tasted their food.  

I forgot that I was a son of kings,  
and I served their king.  

I forgot the Pearl  
for which my parents had sent me.  

And through the heaviness of their foods,  
I fell into deep sleep.  

**Kartadzinu:**
Ma algun manera — non saju kom —  
sapiveru kelu ke non fui sus parente.  

Kommersiaime kon-sus  
e gustavaimu tsibu-sus.  

Obliviaime ke fui filu de reges,  
e serviaime rege-sus.  

Obliviaime la Perla  
por kela kualit mandaveru-me meus parentes.  

E tra lu pesu de tsibus-sus,  
kajaime en somnu profundu.

## VI. THE LETTER FROM FATHER-MOTHER / LA LETTERA DE PATR-MATRI

**English:**
But all this that happened to me,  
my father-mother knew and grieved for me.  

Then a proclamation was published in our kingdom,  
that all should not come to our harbor.  

And they wrote me a letter  
from the King of kings, my father,  
and from my mother-Queen and from my second brother:  

"From your father, King of kings,  
and from your mother, Ruler of the East,  
and from your brother, the second in authority,  
to our son in Egypt, greetings!  

Awaken and arise from your sleep!  
Hear the words of our letter!  

Remember that you are a son of kings!  
See the servitude in which you are serving!  

Remember the Pearl,  
for which we sent you to Egypt!  

Remember your glory-robe  
and your splendid cloak,  
that you may wear them and adorn yourself with them  
and your name may be read in the book of heroes,  
and you may become a deputy with your brother in our kingdom!"  

**Kartadzinu:**
Ma totalmente istu ke akontekaivit a me,  
sapiveru-lu patr-matri-meu e doliveru por me.  

Alora publikavit proklamatsione en rejn-nostru,  
ke totus non venessen a portu-nostru.  

E skribiveru a me lettera  
de Rege de reges, patr-meu,  
e de Rejina-matr-mea e de fratru-meu sekundu:  

"De patre-te, Rege de reges,  
e de matri-tea, Dominatritsa de Oriente,  
e de fratru-te, kelu sekundu en autoritatu,  
a filu-nostru en Egitu, salutatsione!  

Desperta-te e levana-te de somnu-te!  
Ode palavras de lettera-nostra!  

Rekorda ke ses filu de reges!  
Vide kelu servitudine onde stas servante!  

Memora la Perla,  
por kela mandaimu-te a Egitu!  

Rekorda tóga-tea de glória  
e paliu-te splendidu,  
por ke portes-lus e ornes-te kon-lus  
e nóme-te sie letu en libru de heróvis,  
e devenes deputatu kon fratru-te en rejn-nostru!"

## VII. THE AWAKENING / LU DESPERTAINAMENTU

**English:**
Like a royal seal and command,  
the letter came to me.  

It flew in the form of an eagle,  
king of all birds,  
and it flew until it settled near me  
and became entirely words.  

At its voice and its sound,  
I awoke and arose from my sleep.  

I took it and kissed it,  
I broke its seal and read.  

And according to what was written in my heart,  
so it was written in my letter.  

I remembered that I was a son of kings  
and my free soul desired its own.  

I remembered the Pearl  
for which they had sent me to Egypt.  

And I began to enchant the terrible Serpent  
and to subdue him by the name of my Father  
and the name of my second brother  
and the name of our Mother, Queen of the East.  

**Kartadzinu:**
Kom sigillatu rejalu e mandamentu,  
vinistu-me la lettera.  

Volavit en forma de agila,  
rege de totus lus aves,  
e fluvit fina ke asentistu pres me  
e devinistu totalmente palavras.  

A vots-ela e soinu-ela,  
destavaimu e levanaimu de somnu-meu.  

Prenai-la e baziai-la,  
romppai sigillatu-ela e legai.  

E sekundu ke skribitu fut en kor-meu,  
alsi fut skritu en lettera-mea.  

Rekordai ke fui filu de reges  
e anima-mea libera desiravit sus proprius.  

Rekordai la Perla  
por kela mandaveru-me a Egitu.  

E komentsai enkantare Serpente teribile  
e sutszugare-lu per nóme de Patr-meu
e nóme de fratru-meu sekundu
e nóme de Matri-nostra, Rejina de Oriente.  

---

## VIII. THE PEARL / LA PERLA

**English:**
I seized the Pearl  
and turned toward the house of my Father.  

Their filthy and impure garments  
I stripped off and left in their lands,  
and I directed my way  
toward the light of our homeland, the East.  

And my letter, my awakener,  
I found before me on the way.  

And as it had awakened me by its voice,  
so it guided me by its light.  

It was written on royal silk,  
gleaming before me,  
encouraging me by its voice  
and drawing me by its love.  

**Kartadzinu:**
Arpai la Perla  
e turnai vers domo de Patr-meu.  

Vestitus-sus sukidus e impurus  
despulai e lasai en terras-sus,  
e direktaime vja-mea  
vers luts de patria-nostra, Oriente.  

E lettera-mea, despertainadore-meu,  
trovai ante me su la via.  

E kom despertainau-me per vots-ela,  
alsi gwidavit-me per luts-ela.  

Skritu fut su seda rejala,  
brillandu ante me,  
inkuragendu-me per vots-ela  
e trahevut-me per amor-ela.

## IX. THE GLORY-ROBE / LA TOGA-GLORIA

**English:**
I rushed forward and crossed Sarbug.  
I left Babylon to my left,  
and I arrived at Maishan the Great,  
harbor of the sea-merchants.  

And my glory-robe,  
which they had stripped from me,  
and my cloak which they had carried over it,  
my father-mother sent them  
from the heights of Hyrcania,  
by the hand of their treasurers,  
in whom they trusted for their faithfulness.  

I did not remember its form,  
for I had left it in my childhood in my Father's house.  

But suddenly, when I saw it,  
the image gleamed as in a mirror:  
I saw in it my entire self,  
and I recognized myself in it,  
though we were two in separation  
but already one in a single form.  

**Kartadzinu:**
Rusai avante e traversai Sarbug.  
Lasai Babilonia a sinistra-mea,  
e arrivai a Majshan la Granda,  
portu de merkatoris-mar.  

E mea tóga-glória,  
kela tiraverame,  
e paliu-meu kelu portaverame supra,  
mandaveru-lus patr-matri-meu  
de alturas de Hyrcania,  
per manu de trezoreris-sus,  
en ke kofidevut-sus por fidelitatu-sus.  

Non rekordava eu forma-ela,  
porke lasaverame-la en infantsa-mea en domo de Patr-meu.  

Ma subitu, kandu vidai-la,  
image brillavit kom en spekulu:  
vidai en ela totalmente me-mesu,  
e rekonesai me en ela,  
medan nos fussemus doi en separatsione  
ma ja unu en forma sola.  

---

## X. THE UNION / LA UNIONE

**English:**
And the treasurers, carrying it,  
I saw them also in two forms  
for one was their action  
but the royal sign was one in both.  

Riches I saw on the robe,  
preparing itself to gleam,  
and love grew over all its movements.  

It rushed toward me,  
stretching from the hands of the bearers,  
and my love urged me  
that I might rush to it and receive it.  

And I stretched out my hands and took it,  
and I adorned myself with its beauty.  

I clothed myself entirely in my purple and gleaming cloak.  

I put it on, and I rose up to the giver-kingdom  
that had carried it to me in my childhood.  

**Kartadzinu:**
E trezoreris, portantes,  
vidai-lus alsi en doi formas  
porke unu fue aktsione-sus  
ma signalu rejalu unu en ambos.  

Rikisi observai su toga,  
preparante-se por brillare,  
e amor kreskivit su totalmente movimentus.  

Rusavit vers me,  
tendendu-se de manus de portatoris,  
e amor-meu inkitau-me  
por ke rusesse a ela e retsebesse-la.  

E tendai manus-meas e prenai-la,  
e ornaime kon-la belisa-ela.  

Vestiai totalmente me en paliu-meu purpureu e brillante.  

Vestiai-lu, e alzaime fina rejn-donatoris  
ke portaverame-lu en infantsa.

## XI. THE COMPLETE REMEMBERING / LU REKORDAMENTU KOMPLETU

**English:**
And I already remembered all its splendor,  
how it was nurtured in my Father's house.  

My soul already recalled  
its ranks and its greatness.  

So it was woven when it was in my Father's house:  
a marvelous movement was in all its form.  

In colors of gold and beryl,  
rubies and agates,  
sardonyxes and multicolored pearls —  

it was inclined for highest service.  

And according to the Wisdom of the heights  
all its seams conversed with me,  
and I loved it as a companion  
woven from my very self.  

**Kartadzinu:**
E ja rekordava totalmente su splendoru,  
kom nutritu fut en domo de Patr-meu.  

Alma-mea ja memoristu  
gradevis-ela e grandesa-ela.  

Alsi fut teksitu kandu fut en domo de Patr-meu:  
movimentu mirabile fut en totalmente forma-ela.  

En kolorus de oru e berilu,  
rubji e agati,  
sardoniki e perlas multikoloris —  

inklinatu fut por servitsiu altisime.  

E sekundu Sapientsia de alturas  
totalmente suturae-ela konversaveru kon me,  
e amaime-la kom kompanjune  
teksuta de mesu-mesu.  

---

## XII. THE RETURN / LU RETORNU

**English:**
And I saw that a trembling  
was preparing itself throughout all of it,  
the movement of knowledge.  

I saw that it was already preparing itself to speak.  

I heard the murmur of its sound:  

"I am of him most active among the servants,  
for whom my Father made me.  

And I knew that my stature grew  
according to my labors."  

And with royal movements  
it poured itself toward me entirely,  
and from the hands of the bearers  
it hastened that I might already receive it.  

And my love urged me also  
that I might rush toward it and receive it.  

And I stretched it out and took it,  
and I adorned myself with the beauty of its colors.  

I clothed myself entirely  
in my royal and splendid robe.  

**Kartadzinu:**
E vidai ke tremolatsione  
preparastu-se tra totalmente-ela,  
movimentu de konjitsione.  

Vidai ke ja parastu-se por parlare.  

Odai murmuratione de sonu-ela:  

"Eu so de kelu plu aktive inter lus servis,  
por kelu fatserame Patre meu.  

E sapai ke kreskistu statura-mea  
sekundu laboris-meu."  

E kon movimentus rejalis  
versastu-se vers me totalmente,  
e de manus de portatoris  
pretsipavit-se ke ja retsebesse-la.  

E amor-meu inkitau-me alsi  
por ke rusesse vers-ela e retsebesse-la.  

E tendai-la e prenai-la,  
e ornaime kon-la belisa de kolorus-ela.  

Vestiai me totalmente  
en toga-mea rejala e splendida.  

---

## XIII. THE ASCENSION / LA ASENSIONE

**English:**
Clothed in it,  
I rose up to the harbor-peace  
of bowing and worship.  

I bowed my head and worshiped  
the splendor of the Father who had sent it to me,  
whose commandments I had fulfilled  
and I also had fulfilled his commission.  

I mingled myself with the distinguished ones,  
the first ones before the royal harbor.  

And he received me into his house,  
and all his servants venerated.  

And I promised the Father  
that soon I would go to the harbor  
of the King of kings  
and carrying my Pearl,  
I would appear before him.  

**Kartadzinu:**
Vestitu en-ela,  
alzaime fina portu-pats  
de inklinatsione e adoratsione.  

Inklinai kapu-meu e adorai  
splendoru de Patre ke mandau-la a me,  
ke perfektu fue mandamentus-ela  
e eu alsi perfektu fue komisione-ela.  

Meskai me kon lus distinktus,  
lus primu ante portu rejala.  

E retsebau-me en domo-ela,  
e totalmente servis-ela veneraveru.  

E promittau Patre  
ke presto iressu fina portu  
de Rege de reges  
e portandu Perla-mea,  
aparessu ante-elu.
